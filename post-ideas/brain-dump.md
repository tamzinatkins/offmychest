Enola Holmes

In the movie, Edith, a woman of color and a social activist, asked Sherlock Holmes why he wasn't interested in politics. He replies, "Because it's fatally boring," and she comes back with a zinger, "Because you have no interest in changing a world that suits you so well," pointing out his privilege so eloquently.

# Confidence Kit - October 2020

that have empowered me to be intentional and happy. I use these resources for career growth, as well as navigating life in general.

. My self-confidence used to be locked in a vault - but I had the key. My self-confidence....

A lot of people have been self-reflecting while staying at home due to COVID-19, and I'm one of them.

During my time sheltering in place for COVID, I've spent more time self-reflecting on my life, what I want from it, and exploring my views of what it means for me to be happy and successful. I have acknowledged that I am quick to think negatively of myself, especially as it relates to my career. I've been working hard to build my self-confidence - because I need to be the strongest advocate for myself. Below I have listed various forms of media and resources that helped me build my self-confidence - that, yeah, I CAN do it, and I WILL. 

I've been working on my confidence 

* Networking
* Interviewing

Career

* Asking for a raise
* Voicing concerns regarding issues in the workplace
* Traveling alone internationally to work with external partners on behalf of the company

Play

* Riding motorcycles

* Snowboarding

* Backpacking

  

* 

* Try something new outside of work - learn and practice skills and go out and experience new things - remember what uncertainty feels like, and how it feels when you overcome a challenge. You'll find activities you're passionate about, which helps in living a life where you're satisfied with how you're managing work and home life. Keep learning!

The 4-Hour Workweek 

**My Favorite Murder**

The title seems dark, but give it a go. It's funny, it's dark, and it serves as a mental-health support group to some. Hosted by Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark, they share stories of true crime and murder, delivering in a way only they can. I really enjoy this podcast when I want to turn off from career topics, or want some company while I tackle my chores.

this idea of knowing the flip-side is valuable elsewhere - not just saying you don't want to work anymore tonight, but then not providing yourself WITH an activity of what TO do, that I find myself falling back into doing work instead of some other personal activity, because I simply didn't know what TO do.

After college, you're very likely to be working on a team with engineers of different disciplines, as well as non-engineers - be open to learning about their disciplines and don't bash their chosen discipline - respect everyone equally - 


Why I didn't consider CS in college
I thought computer science wasn't for me - because I'm female. So I didn't try it. I felt like I wanted to open the computer science education door, and take a peak, and subsequently slammed it shut - and I regret not feeling comfortable to explore it more. I felt like it was my job to get in and out (aka: graduate in four years) - take my requirements to graduate, not wanting to pay for additional courses.
