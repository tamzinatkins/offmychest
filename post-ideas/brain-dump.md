Enola Holmes

In the movie, Edith, a woman of color and a social activist, asked Sherlock Holmes why he wasn't interested in politics. He replies, "Because it's fatally boring," and she comes back with a zinger, "Because you have no interest in changing a world that suits you so well," pointing out his privilege so eloquently.

## Confidence Kit - October 2020

that have empowered me to be intentional and happy. I use these resources for career growth, as well as navigating life in general.

. My self-confidence used to be locked in a vault - but I had the key. My self-confidence....

A lot of people have been self-reflecting while staying at home due to COVID-19, and I'm one of them.

During my time sheltering in place for COVID, I've spent more time self-reflecting on my life, what I want from it, and exploring my views of what it means for me to be happy and successful. I have acknowledged that I am quick to think negatively of myself, especially as it relates to my career. I've been working hard to build my self-confidence - because I need to be the strongest advocate for myself. Below I have listed various forms of media and resources that helped me build my self-confidence - that, yeah, I CAN do it, and I WILL. 

I've been working on my confidence 

* Networking
* Interviewing

Career

* Asking for a raise
* Voicing concerns regarding issues in the workplace
* Traveling alone internationally to work with external partners on behalf of the company

Play

* Riding motorcycles

* Snowboarding

* Backpacking

  

* 

* Try something new outside of work - learn and practice skills and go out and experience new things - remember what uncertainty feels like, and how it feels when you overcome a challenge. You'll find activities you're passionate about, which helps in living a life where you're satisfied with how you're managing work and home life. Keep learning!

The 4-Hour Workweek 

**My Favorite Murder**

The title seems dark, but give it a go. It's funny, it's dark, and it serves as a mental-health support group to some. Hosted by Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark, they share stories of true crime and murder, delivering in a way only they can. I really enjoy this podcast when I want to turn off from career topics, or want some company while I tackle my chores.

this idea of knowing the flip-side is valuable elsewhere - not just saying you don't want to work anymore tonight, but then not providing yourself WITH an activity of what TO do, that I find myself falling back into doing work instead of some other personal activity, because I simply didn't know what TO do.

After college, you're very likely to be working on a team with engineers of different disciplines, as well as non-engineers - be open to learning about their disciplines and don't bash their chosen discipline - respect everyone equally - 


Why I didn't consider CS in college
I thought computer science wasn't for me - because I'm female. So I didn't try it. I felt like I wanted to open the computer science education door, and take a peak, and subsequently slammed it shut - and I regret not feeling comfortable to explore it more. I felt like it was my job to get in and out (aka: graduate in four years) - take my requirements to graduate, not wanting to pay for additional courses.

12/26/20 Billie Eilish interview
Describe yourself one year from now
More confident, better speaker (use less filler words, be a stronger presenter)
Be happy with following my priorities
Be less self-critical, frustrated by myself (making progress getting rid of bad habits)

One thing you have now, but not a year ago?

What's most important to you right now?
Staying happy
Luke - he has been an instrumental part of my support system while I navigate the stresses and fears related to finding a new job

Find a new job - excited for the new experiences, leave the plateau I feel at Shaper

What's the biggest thing you're struggling with?
Stepping away from work; doing nothing - do nothing "productive" - I find myself often trying to do things in order to be productive - I want to get better at doing nothing. Taking time to journal and write is helping. Take more time to be creative - blogging is definitely helping, and I did my first Origin project in a while of the oversized Christmas light garland.

Who do you turn to for guidance?
Luke - great resource for descalating stress, and for making decisions
I have also begun sending cold email connection request messages on LinkedIn, wanting to learn from others about their journey in Program Management

What will you embark on for the first time?
Improve public speaking - maybe join Toastmasters? Improv classes?

What was the first think you did when you woke up this morning?
Used the restroom and let the dogs out (Jack and Ollie).

Technological thing that blows your mind?
SpaceX's reusable rockets - those have been fascinating to see this year

What's a positive thing in the news right now?
Vaccines for Covid-19 have started getting dispersed - although who they're being given to as first priority could be debated - why are hospital admins who are working from home first in line?

A fear a year from now?
Not having found a new job to grow in my career - new challenges, new people, new work environment. Regret that I haven't pushed myself out of my comfort zone "enough" - I know that's not quantifiable - but progress is good. Better is good.

Biggest thing to happen to my career:
Stood up to the disrespectful behavior I was feeling aginst Greg as my new manager. Even though I wasn't pleased with the outcome, I'm proud of myself for standing up and speaking out.

Favorite musical artist:
Lizzo

How often do you talk to your family?
Once a week

Favorite movie?
Enola Holmes was really good.

What aspirations do you have?
I want to grow as a TPM, be assertive in how scheduling and planning is going to go. Develop workflows to be better about listing my work tasks in GitHub.
Be a more confident conductor and leader of projects.

Who is your best friend?
Elise

Are you more confident this year compared to last?
Yes! This year I was confident to approach Kubba and Jen about Greg's behavior towards me, and i was like - you know what, I'm gonna put myself out on the job market! Recording myself and prepping and doing interviews has really helped my self-confidence.

What advice would you give yourself a year ago?
Go with your gut - even if changing course is uncomfortable. You grow for your learning experiences, much like how you learn most from your failures - stretch, do something new or uncomfortable - like interviewing for new jobs.

Changing the name of the blog
explore, or me, me and mind, sharing is caring, 
The phrase "off my chest" comes with the idea of ideas having been repressed. Yes, that may be the case for some posts or topics, but it doesn't encompass everything I want to share here.

You are a Badass: How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness and Start Living an Awesome Life by Jen Sincero
On the otherside of your fear is your freedom.
The only failure is quiting. Everything else is just gathering information." This quote reminds me another one of my favorite sayings: rejection is redirection.
Deciding is freedom; indecision is torture.
Obstacles and challenges are the agents of growth.

On affirmations: the more emotion you feel around what you're saying, the more power it will have to bring about positive change

1. List off your old stories that you've gotten into the habit of thinking and saying
2. Journal about the false rewards you get from them
3. Feel into these false rewards, thank them for their help, and decide to let them go
4. Take each false reward and write a new powerful story to replace it with
5. Repeat this new story or affirmation over and over and over, until it becomes your thruth
6. Behold your awesome new life


On the other side of your fear is your freedom.
Ways to help navigate your way through the jungle of fear:
1. View fear from your reearview mirror - envision your challenges from the future, look back on them from a place of victory, and they will lose much of their power to paralyze you
2. -----

The only failure is quiting. Everything else is just gathering information. <<<Rejection is redirection>>>

The terror around making the wrong decision can be so overwhelming to some people that they develop the habit of a) waffling back and forth, paralyzed by self-doubt and terror, finally eeking out a "decision" that they then proceed to change over and over and over again, b) making decisions hastily, without thinking or feeling into them - their main goal being to escape the discomfort and get the damn thing over with already, or c) being so afraid that if they pick one thing, they'll miss out on another, so they either choose to do nothing, or try to do everything, which are both excellent ways to miss out on all of it. They basically decide to never decide because they don't want to make the wrong decision... Deciding is freedom; indecision is torture. Indecision is one of the most popular tricks for staying stuck within the boundaries of what's safe and familiar, which is why a common trait of successful people is that they make decisions quickly and change them slowly...Immediately face the damn thing and start working through your decision making process...

Fear is a choice.

All life is either moving forward and evolving, or shrinking back and dying. If you want to evolve in your own life, you have to push through the obstacles, instead of running from them. Obstacles and challenges are the agents of growth. 



Wellness
Physical: walk and row
Mental:
Emotional:

The Year of Action - I tend to default to over-thinking, over-reading, over-analyzing instead of just getting started.

Investment: self-education 

Year of Balance, I tend to overdo certain aspects of my life (usually uni/work-related) and then spend way too little time on other important thing

Progress

I’ve noticed that I’m not using all of my time intentionally. I sometimes find myself on social media for too long, messing up my sleep schedule, eating poorly, and getting distracted while studying. I obviously want to do these less often. I usually just find myself in these situations, I never try to spend more time on twitter and I never try to eat more fast food, but it still happens. I want to spend my time more intentionally, doing the things that I think are important. To help with this, I’m going to try time tracking for the first time once I get back to college.

Self-balance
Breaking down barriers
Getting outside your comfort zone

Year of Order. Trying to start journaling, keeping track of my assignments better, keeping my spaces cleaner, and establishing a better daily routine

The Year of Presence.

I aim to start out in a new career, share/create public facing projects, & meet new people both in person & online.


Promotion and pro-motion

Year of the Chisel!

Overall trying to focus on creation over consumption & working on the "hammer" (the systems such as exercise in my life) to my chisel so I can continue improving.

When scheduling meetings, have the end time be 5 minutes to the hour/half hour, etc, to allow a buffer time in between meetings - time to sign off, mentally regroup before your next meeting - ideally, maybe avoid back to back meetings, to give you more transition time, so you also have adequate time to review your notes for a meeting that's likely on a completely different topic than your previous one.

Switch off from work



Observe weekends
I started doing some of my weekly chores Thursday and Friday evenings, so I could enjoy my weekends more. More often, my weekends were becoming the time when I addressed my personal to do list, having worked from my work to do list all week. 



Prioritize me

### Prioritize myself
I want to do a better job of prioritizing myself. 
There's a saying: "you can't pour from an empty cup." People often use the example of securing your own oxygen mask on an airplane before assisting others to explain the idea. I used to prioritize all the household chores before I could enjoy sitting on the couch. Guess what - there's always a chore to do, a space you could tidy, or a cabinet you could reorganize.

Do something for me every day and enjoy the moment. Here are some examples that I'll be practicing more often:
* Spend an extra few minutes to use an exfoliating face scrub twice a week
---
And if comparing yourself against other humans isn't overwhelming enough, we're constantly bombarded with advertisements telling us that we aren't good enough. That only after we purchase their product, will we be happy. That we need this hair dye to be beautiful. Or, we'll feel on top of the world once we purchase that car.
