You are your best advocate - yes, you! Self-confidence is so important. I'd like to share some resources of various mediums that help me remain encouraged and motivated.

## Music

**Fearless, by MALINDA**

My go-to pump-up song.

## Podcasts

**The Intentional Advantage**

This podcast really helps me self-reflect. Host Tanya Dalton discusses topics surrounding career and productivity, and themes each season, comprised of approximately 13 episodes. Learn more about the podcast [here](https://tanyadalton.com/podcast). For example, the theme for Season 15, which wrapped up recently, was *strategies for success*. Two episodes I really enjoyed from Season 15 were:

* **192: How to Stop Hesitating and Start Getting What You Want**: As I said earlier, you are your best advocate!
* **193: Embracing Your Expertise**: Many women are hesitant to own the title of "expert," and Dalton explains why and how we should own it. In addition, here's the [link](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/354649) to the article Dalton wrote for Entrepreneur that she refers to in this episode.

**Her Stem Story**

This podcast focuses on stories surrounding STEM careers. Host Prasha Dutra shares her experience along with those of her guests to empower others. Learn more about the podcast [here](https://herstemstory.com/).

## Film

**Enola Holmes**

I enjoyed this adventurous film, which is available on Netflix. It follows Enola Holmes, the younger sister of Sherlock Holmes, as she searches for her mother, with the backdrop of women's suffrage and social reform. 

## Networking

**Girl Geek X** 

Girl Geek X hosts events for women in tech, of all disciplines, providing an incredibly positive and empowering environment for listening to female speakers and connecting with others. I really enjoy attending these events. Check out the Girl Geek X website [here](https://girlgeek.io/).
