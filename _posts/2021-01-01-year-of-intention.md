I'm not making any New Year's resolutions. Instead, I've decided to follow a yearly theme. Let me tell you more. 

## What is a yearly theme?

The yearly theme was introduced to me while listening to the podcast [Cortex](https://www.relay.fm/cortex), hosted by CGP Grey and Myke Hurley. A yearly theme puts an emphasis on making forward progress - moving the needle from your current state towards where you want to be. And, themes are meant to be broad.

*What are you looking to achieve? What do you want to focus on? What do you want to improve upon?*

After reading this, I invite you to listen to the following Cortex Yearly Theme Episodes:
* [#62: 2018 Yearly Themes](https://www.relay.fm/cortex/62)
* [#79: 2019 Yearly Themes](https://www.relay.fm/cortex/79)
* [#95: 2020 Yearly Themes](https://www.relay.fm/cortex/95)
* [#110: 2021 Yearly Themes](https://www.relay.fm/cortex/110)

## Why do I prefer a yearly theme?
Because I'm a strong believer that **better is good**. Progress is success. I'm often my harshest critic, and I'm working on keeping a positive mindset.

*What little steps or actions can you take every single day to move your needle?*

With a year like 2020, we know all too well that a year may not go as we had planned. I appreciate the malleability of a yearly theme, and sprinkle in some measurable goals along the way. I want to feel content with what I accomplish each day, and be happy with how I spent my time that day. It's not about getting everything done, rather, getting everything I want to get done, done.

## Why intention?

To be intentional in making progress, I must focus on myself, and my needle, and not compare myself to others. I ended 2020 listening to Jen Sincero's [You are a Badass: How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness and Start Living an Awesome Life](https://www.amazon.com/You-Are-Badass%C2%AE-Doubting-Greatness/dp/0762447699/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) audiobook for a nice momentum boost, and I began 2021 watching [The Minimalists: Less Is Now](https://www.netflix.com/title/81074662?mc_cid=10dd42fde5&mc_eid=4a862fbef5) on Netflix. *Less is Now* is a continuation of the story told in [Minimalism](https://www.netflix.com/title/80114460?s=a&trkid=13747225&t=cp) (also on Netflix), and in part, discusses the importance of looking within - *what is your definition of success and happiness?* Because others will have their own, and different criteria. Comparing ourselves to others is overwhelming, and unnecessary.

It's also important to remember that personal growth is only natural. We'll meet our own goals and seek out new ones. We evolve, and so will our goals and definitions of success and happiness. I want to be mindful that I'm changing me for me, and not for impressing others.

*Less is Now* asks the viewer to reflect on this question: *what brings value to your life?*

Side note: It's no coincidence that I enjoy Matt D'Avella's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/blackboxfilmcompany). Matt is the director of both *Minimalism* and *The Minimalists: Less Is Now*. I also invite you to check out Matt's content.

## How I want to be more intentional

### Reading and Writing

I started this blog late in 2020, and I want to continue posting on a regular basis. It's been very rewarding finding creative outlets for myself, where in the past, most of my outlets have entailed physical exercise, including running, hiking, and snowboarding. I still love hiking and snowboarding, and I now go on walks instead of runs. It's something new - something to revisit. Growing up, my least favorite school subjects were reading and writing, but now, when I have the freedom to choose what I read and write, it's been refreshing to partake in these activities - I don't carry that dread in my head.

I also want to journal every week to spend time reflecting and exploring thoughts. What I'm grateful for. Recounting a transformative experience. Or diving deeper into a conversation I had earlier with a friend. Some of these topics will be shared here on this blog.

### Coloring
Continuing within the creativity realm, I enjoy coloring in coloring books, like [this one](https://www.johannabasford.com/book/secret-garden/). This is another activity I started in 2020 and one I want to bring into 2021 and beyond. I find it to be relaxing, and a nice way to wind down.

### Do nothing

I want to do nothing. Intentionally. Doing nothing is a struggle, so I want to integrate meditation into my daily life. To be more present, and less distracted. With my busy brain, I'm often asking myself, "how is this productive?" Read: what chore should I be doing? What space could I tidy? Guess what. Rest is important. I want to enjoy more small moments each day, and pace myself for a long and marvelous life. 

### Limit my scrolling

Particularly the news. Don't get me wrong, I think it's important to be an informed citizen of the world. But I don't need to check it every 15 minutes.

There you have it! I'm looking forward to reflecting on this down the road. Happy New Year, everyone.
