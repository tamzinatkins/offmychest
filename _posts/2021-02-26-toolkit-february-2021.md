My yearly theme for 2021 is [Intention](https://tamzinatkins.com/self-improvement/2021/01/01/year-of-intention.html). Today, I'm sharing three resources that I've found to be helpful while I strive to focus on what matters to me.

## Book

**Make Time, by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky**

[Make Time](https://jakeknapp.com/make-time) provides many strategies for making small changes in our daily lives to help us live our lives the way we really want to, and how to achieve more of what we want.

## Video

**Headspace Guide to Meditation** 

[Headspace Guide to Meditation](https://www.netflix.com/title/81280926) is presented as an series on Netflix. Andy Puddicombe, co-founder of Headspace, introduces the what, how, and why of meditation, and guides the viewer through an approximate 10 minute meditation each episode. Headspace also has an app where subscribers gain access to guided meditations. 

## App

**Insight Timer**

When possible, I like to start with free apps when trying something new. [Insight Timer](https://insighttimer.com/) is a free app with a library of guided meditations along with calm and soothing options to help you fall asleep. I've been listening to guided meditations around letting go of stress and anxiety, and affirmations for self-confidence. It's also been helpful when falling asleep, switching between music and spoken word.
