I like to make the analogy that projects resemble the human body.

The body relies on multiple systems working in sync to remain functional. Projects are similar.

## Digestive System

The digestive system represents the **project life cycle**. Just like projects, the digestive system has a distinct beginning and end. 

The Five Stages of the Digestive Project Life Cycle
1. The Mouth (Initiation)
    * outline the purpose (ie: business case) and requirements of the project
2. The Stomach (Planning)
    * define scope
    * define project management plan: schedule, milestones, and communication and risk management plans
    * define roles and responsibilites
3. The Duodenum (Execution) *The duodenum is the first section of the small intestine, where stomach contents mix with digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the liver*
    * kick off meeting
    * assign resources 
    * task assignments
    * set up tracking systems
4. The Small Intestine (Monitor and Control)
    * use Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure project performance - ensure the quality of deliverables
    * adjust schedule and resources as applicable
5. The Large Intesting (Close) 
    * final project review
    * lessons learned

## Skeletal System

In a project, the skeletal system is comprised of the **team members** - the group building the deliverables. This core group has specific areas of expertise that enable them to execute on project activities, making them the foundation, or structure, of a project, much like a skeleton provides structure to a vertebrate.

## Nervous System

The nervous system represents all **stakeholders**, including the product owner or client, and their opinions on the project overall and specific activities. Stakeholders are anyone and everyone who is actively involved with the project and whose interests are impacted, positively or negatively, by the project. What messages are the nerves receiving? And how are those messages received by the brain (ultimate decision maker: product owner or client)? The nervous system is responsible for stimulating muscles - it's important for the project manager to be assessing feedback from project stakeholders - is the project progressing satisfactorily for the stakeholders?

## Muscular System

The **project manager** is the muscular system - acting as the connective tissue to drive a successful project, empowering team members to be successful and work together. The project manager evaluates inputs from the stakeholders, or nervous system, and orchestrates the development team, or skeletal system, as applicable.

## Circulatory System

The circulatory system represents **risks and issues**. I think of roadblocks as being similar to one’s circulation getting cut off. If there is a resource missing, it’s difficult for a team member to complete a task without a resource they were relying on. On the flip side, opportunities are similar to circulation being reintroduced to an extremity or other area in the body.
